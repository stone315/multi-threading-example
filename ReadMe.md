This repository provides serval multi-threading examples from CS 107.
The program uses a unoffical thread_107 provided by Summerlve (https://github.com/Summerlve/Programming-Paradigms-Execs/tree/master/16/thread_107).
Therefore, there are some changes different from the example in CS 107.



To compile the script, run the following command.


'''
gcc target thread_107.c -o a.out -w -g -lpthread
'''

example:

'''
gcc main.c thread_107.c -o a.out -w -g -lpthread
'''
